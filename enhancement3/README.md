# Enhancement Three – Databases

## 1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

This artifact is the final project I submitted for IT-140 in August 2023, and this enhancement is the third and final update to the program for my capstone. The program is a text-based adventure written in Python where the player explores a castle to collect items that will help you defeat the dragon hiding somewhere within. While this program is relatively simple, it has useful features such as navigation, an inventory system, win/lose conditions, and more.

## 2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

This artifact was chosen to demonstrate the skills I’ve learned in databases. Instead of enhancing a project with an existing database, I wanted to implement a brand new one in my first ever program. I want this artifact to demonstrate my ability to implement a novel solution into existing code, that has a solid core and will easily scale with future updates. It also demonstrates my ability to create an efficient database schema.

For the purposes of this enhancement and program, the database I’m adding will manage new save and load game functions. Laying the database framework will open the program to future possibilities, such as multiple player profiles and high scores. This change greatly enhances my artifact, as it adds completely new functionality for being able to save and load a game, while building the foundation to scale the program with ease.

> ⚠️ Note: The database file (`trogdor_save.db`) is **automatically created** by the program if one does not already exist. There is no need to include it in the repository.

## 3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

I planned to meet outcomes 3 and 4 with this enhancement, which I believe I achieved. For the project, I believe that I have met outcomes 2–5.

## 4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

I think with this artifact I learned how much I enjoy modifying and enhancing existing code. It was really gratifying to add a database and successfully implement a significant enhancement like the ability to save and load your game. It also gave me a lot of perspective on developing new code. I always felt a bit of pressure writing new programs, wanting them to be perfect from the start. But I need to trust the iterative process more, and be sure to build a strong codebase that can be enhanced as needed.
